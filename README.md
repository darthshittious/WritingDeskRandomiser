# WritingDeskRandomiser
A really simple discord bot for dante's writing desk server. It's public just so he can download there's nothing to see here shoo

## To run
 - Install python >= 3.8.2 (from [here](https://python.org/downloads), and make sure to add python to PATH. It'll be shown as an option on the installer)
 - From terminal or powershell, run `python3 --version` to check if you have an appropriate version installed.
 - Run `git clone https://github.com/darthshittious/WritingDekRandomiser.git` to clone this repo into your machine.
   If this doesn't work, download the code as zip and extract it
 - Then in your terminal or powershell, run `python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt` from inside the bot's folder.
 - Create a file called config.py in the same directory as these files and add in the line `TOKEN = '' # put your bot's token within the quotes`
 - To finally run the bot using python, simply enter `python3 bot.py` from terminal in the same directory as the file.
 - Kill the running file by using cmd + C or ctrl + C when done.
 - To host perpetually use systemd to host on an Ubuntu virtual machine, since that's really easy to configure.
